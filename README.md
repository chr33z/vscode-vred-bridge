# VRED Bridge

## Visual Studio Code Tools for Autodesk VRED

Writing complex plugins for Autodesk VRED can be a tedious process. This extension aims to provide tools to help with VRED plugin development and get rid of some shortcomings of the default workflow. **This extension provides a direct way to run python scripts in VRED from VS Code, without copying it to the internal VRED editor.**

## Howto

1. Activate VRED internal webinterface in the webinterface preferences: [Webinterface Preferences](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/vred-products/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2021/ENU/VRED/files/Preferences/VRED-Preferences-WebInterface-Preferences-html-html.html)
2. Set the port number in VRED Bridge to the port number you set in the webinterface preferences (default is "8888"). Open the command "VRED Bridge: Set port number" in VS Code with ```Ctrl + Shift + P``` and typing in the command. This step is optional since VREDs default port is also 8888.
3. Start writing a python script in a new file and run the command "VRED Bridge: Run python" by opening the command line with ```Ctrl + Shift + P``` and typing the command.
